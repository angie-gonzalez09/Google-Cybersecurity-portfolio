# Google-Cybersecurity-portfolio 
This repository showcases all my cybersecurity projects completed through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate on Coursera. 
Each portfolio activity is labeled using the format C# for the certificate number and M# for the module it belongs to.
These hands-on projects demonstrate my growing skills in threat analysis, incident response, compliance auditing, and security Frameworks.
